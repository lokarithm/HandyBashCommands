Some handy bash files for Linux

## 001 - Convert HEIC files to jpg format

This bash script will convert all the files with heic extension in that same path to jpg format by default.

- To use this script to convert to png:

```diff
    ./heic-converter.sh -p
```

 


- To use this script to convert to jpg:

```diff
    ./heic-converter.sh 
```

 
 
 Note that the "-p" option is a bit slower than the jpg format.
